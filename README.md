# Venue

The CLI gem that I've designed is focused on listing the top 5 venues to see indie music in Philadelphia. 
User is also able to get the address, phone number, and a short info paragraph about the selected venue.

## Installation

git clone using this SSH: git@github.com:belsonrj/venue.git

HTTPS: https://github.com/belsonrj/venue.git

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'venue'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install venue

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
